          The goal of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as
          close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
          <br /><br />
          Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack,
          Queen, King) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11, depending on
          your hand. Aces automatically take the value that benefits your hand
          the most, so they will default to 1 if choosing 11 would cause you to
          bust.
          <br /><br />
          The game begins with the dealer serving two initial cards to both the
          player and themselves. You won't see the dealer's second card
          initially.
          <br /><br />
          You choose to 'Hit' to receive another card or 'Stand' to keep your
          current hand. It is the dealer's turn when you stand.
          <br /><br />
          You win the game if your hand value is closer to 21 than the dealer's,
          without going over 21. If your hand value equals 21, you win
          immediately. You lose if your hand value exceeds 21 or if the dealer's
          hand is closer to 21 than yours.
          <br /><br />
          It can also be a tie if your hand has the same value as the dealer's
          hand.
          <br /><br />
          Have fun and good luck! ♥️
